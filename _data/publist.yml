- title: "Dynamic Multi-Task Learning for Face Recognition with Facial Expression"
  image: multi-task_learning_for_face_recognition.jpg
  description: We demonstrate our approach for face recognition with facial expression and facial expression recognition from a single input image based on a deep multi-task learning Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs). Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic multi-task learning method. This multi-task learning with dynamic weights also boosts of the performance on the different tasks comparing to the state-of-art methods with single-task learning.

- title: "Ready, steady, touch! sensing physical contact with a finger-mounted IMU"
  image: Finger-MountedIMU.png
  description: Studies show that a single nail-mountedIMU on the index finger provides sufficient data to train a binary touch status classifier (i.e., touch vs. no-touch), with an accuracy above 95%, generalised across users. This model, trained on a rigid tabletop surface, was found to retain an average accuracy of 96% for 7 other types of everyday surfaces with varying rigidity, and in walking and sitting scenarios where no touch occurred. ActualTouch can be combined with other interaction techniques, such as in a uni-stroke gesture recogniseron arbitrary surfaces, where touch status from ActualTouch is used to delimit the motion gesture data that feed into there cogniser. We demonstrate the potential of ActualTouch in a range of scenarios, such as interaction for augmented reality applications, and leveraging daily surfaces and objects for ad-hoc interactions.

  image: VibHand.png
  description: Visual graphics are widely spread in digital media and are useful in many contexts of daily life. However, access to this type of graphical information remains a challenging task for people with visual impairments (VI). In this study, we designed and evaluated an on-hand vibrotactile interface that enables users with VI to explore digital graphics presented on tablets. We first conducted a set of exploratory tests with both people with VI and blindfolded (BF) people to investigate several design factors. We then conducted a comparative experiment to verify that on-hand vibrotactile cues (indicating direction and progression) can enhance the non-visual exploration of digital graphics. The results based on 12 participants with VI and 12 BF participants confirmed the usability of the technique and revealed that the visual status of the users does not impact graphics identification and comparison tasks.

- title: "FaceLiveNet+: A Holistic Networks For Face Authentication Based On Dynamic Multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: This paper proposes a holistic multi-task Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the dynamic weights of the tasks, namely FaceLiveNet+, for face authentication. FaceLiveNet+ can employ face verification and facial expression recognition as a solution of liveness control simultaneously. Comparing to the single-task learning, the proposed multi-task learning can better capture the feature representation for all of the tasks. The experimental results show the superiority of the multi-task learning to the single-task learning for both the face verification task and facial expression recognition task. Rather using a conventional multi-task learning with fixed weights for the tasks, this work proposes a so called dynamic-weight-unit to automatically learn the weights of the tasks. The experiments have shown the effectiveness of the dynamic weights for training the networks. Finally, the holistic evaluation for face authentication based on the proposed protocol has shown the feasibility to apply the FaceLiveNet+ for face authentication.

We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.

  description: We directly test the consistency of results from these three techniques by comparing data from the correlated metal Sr2RhO4. Using ARPES, STM, and quantum oscillations, we find good agreement for the Fermi surface topography and carrier effective masses. Hence, the apparent absence of such an agreement in other quantum materials, including the cuprates, suggests that the electronic states in these materials are of different, non-Fermi liquid-like nature.
